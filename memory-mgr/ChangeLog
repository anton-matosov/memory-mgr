*****************************************************************************************************************
Version 1.2.0b (svn rev. 300, June 07, 2008):
------------------------------------
Performance improvements:
 - 10%    fixed memory alignment for static_bitset that used by bit_manager, now bitset is uses memory starting from fifth byte, first four bytes used by bit_manager, updated malloc_allocator and memory_manager constructor comments to fit this changes
 - 250%   changed caching algorithm in bit_manager, now instead of caching of the block index used in for previous allocation, it will cache bit_hint - a bit number that used as a hint for static_bitset for find_n operation, it points to: prev_alloc_bit+prev_alloc_bits_count. 
 - 20-25% implemented alignment of allocatable memory area. for this purpose was implemented template that can round integer value to specified base value. 
 - 10-15% removed update_size routine from size_tracking implementation
