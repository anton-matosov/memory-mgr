In dev:
 - namespace managers was renamed to memory_mgr
 - pointer classes were moved to separate files
 - pointers and cast helper function were moved to ptr_helpers.h file
 - RTTI was disabled for VS projects
 - added VS2005 projects
 - singleton updated to have to separate parameters for instantiation type
   and for return type
 - implemented std_pointer class for heap_memory
 - implemented pointer traits class
 - type definitions were standardized: 
   suffix "_type" will be used in all typedefs

Version 0.6.3 beta
 - license agreement was added
 - compiler dependent code was removed
 - added support for linux platform
 - added synchronization to managers
 - heap_memory_manager was re-implemented as decorator heap_memory
 - added deallocate method overload
 - pointer type was made a template parameter of memory_manager
 - fixed allocation sync issues
 - added null_ptr - a null pointer of ptr_t type
 - added type manipulation library
 - added simple_ptr template class - a basic class for all smart pointers

Version 0.6.0
 - implemented generic singleton
 - implemented singleton manager (heap_memory_manager)
 - some design modifications made
 - added separate template singleton_manager which allows to make singleton 
   any manager 
 - solution was renamed
 - added base class for managed objects
 - implemented memory limits checking (std::bad_alloc will be thrown 
   if manager is out of memory)
 - implemented deallocation checking (on second deallocation of the same 
   pointer assertion will stop program execution)
 - implemented nothrow version of operator new in managed_base class
 - fixed issue in static_bitset test() method 
 - unit tests updated
 - added empty() and free() methods to memory managers
 - fixed test case object name in tests macro
 - files were restructured
 - removed unused project's folders
